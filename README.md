#Simple implementaion of Luhn's Algorithm

Some credit card companies use Luhn algorithm to detect invalid credit card numbers. The key thing in this algorithm is to find a check digit, which should be the rightmost digit in any credit card number.
this program asks the user to enter series of one-digit positive numbers then it is saved into a one-dimensional array; the number -1 is used to indicate the end of series. The maximum size of the array is set to 20.
